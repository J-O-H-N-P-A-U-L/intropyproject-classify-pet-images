Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Answer: 
They were all very different, but here is why. The dog pictured is named Buster, a Bolognese Terrier wearing a red wig so as to disguise his appearance. The models looked at him and the wig fooled each into providing the following results:
Alexnet:
Classifier: irish setter, red setter 
Resnet: 
Classifier: blenheim spaniel
VGG:
Classifier: clumber, clumber spaniel

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
Alexnet:
Classifier: welsh springer spaniel 
Resnet: 
Classifier: old english sheepdog, bobtail
VGG:
Classifier: clumber, clumber spaniel (same classification)

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
I feel that they all did a decent job (especially down to Buster wearing his disguise) In this instance, I feel that VGG did the best job for the dog as it consistently guessed the dog breed (although incorrect due to disguise) even with a horizontally flipped dog image. BUT Resent and Alexnet did correctly identify the correct type of other animal (owl). How do I score this as it was so close? They were all Wrong with the tart, although I suppose a  “bagel” might be the closest. So if its down to the tart, it has to be awarded to Resent in this instance - but a very hard one to score indeed!
